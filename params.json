{"name":"UMWSN","body":"### Introduction\r\nThe Universial Middleware for Wireless Sensor Networks is a project by the Centre for Communication Systems Research [CCSR](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/ccsr/) at the University of Surrey, United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nExploiting Wireless Sensor Networks for areas such as the Internet of Things, Smarter Planet and other fancy domains is the new trend in current research. With the use of sensor/actuator networks, a large amount of low-level\r\ndevices with limited capabilities have to be integrated into a service based virtual world. \r\n\r\nThis software can be used to bridge this gap, and abstract from the underlying low-level networks to provide a uni\ffied access layer to the sensors and the information they provide.\r\n\r\nIn future we add more smart capabilities such as Data Aggregation, Semantic Service Provisioning and Knowledge Abstraction.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n* Support for Oracle Sunspot Devices\r\n* Support for RESTful based Sensors\r\n* Support for Google Weather Api\r\n* Modular (through plugins) Design\r\n* Data Aggregation through Symbolic Approximation Algorithms [SAX](http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/SAX.htm)\r\n* Web Interface\r\n\r\n### Research behind the work\r\nThere has been some research in line with this software implementation. You can find related papers on the following website [Research Page](http://personal.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/F.Ganz/)\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nThe software relies on several open-source components (scipy,numpy, mongodb, ....) and will be installed during the setup process.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone git@github.com:fganz/UMWSN.git\r\n$ cd ./UMWSN\r\n$ python setup.py install\r\n$ python core/UMWSN.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Developers Guide\r\nIn the next day we publish a developers guide.\r\n","tagline":"Universal Middleware for Wireless Sensor Networks","google":"UA-23302389-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
